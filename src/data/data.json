I hold a degree in Software Engineering with a strong academic record and research experience in Natural Language Processing, where I worked on speech and text understanding. Bringing together my full-stack expertise, hands-on experience with LLM applications, and academic foundation in NLP, I am passionate about applying Artificial Intelligence to software engineering — exploring how LLMs and intelligent automation can improve coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance while advancing developer tools, software quality, and the overall developer experience."
